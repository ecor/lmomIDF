abstract = {Current precipitation frequency analysis used as a standard for urban runoff calculations are out of date. In this paper, the form of the distribution governing rainfall intensity of various durations in a regional context is investigated using the method of L-moments. The results indicate that the currently used Gumbel type I distribution is not generally valid for all the durations considered in this analysis. The form of the distribution is dependent on the duration of the event being considered.}
