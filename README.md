Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves usefully quantify extreme
precipitation over various duration, e.g. from 1 to 360 hours, and
return periods for engineering design, e.g. the interest in the time
concentration or time-structure of the rainfall.

(e.g. @Courty2019) Generally a mathematical function that relates the
rainfall intensity with its duration and frequency of occurrence, as
follows:

.\[1\] These curves are commonly used in hydrology for flood forecasting
and civil engineering for urban drainage design. However, the IDF curves
are also analysed in hydrometeorology because of the interest in the
time concentration or time-structure of the rainfall.\[2\] Additionally,
Heidari et al., (2020) recently developed IDF curves for drought events

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
